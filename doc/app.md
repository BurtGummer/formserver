# App settings

All settings and message strings are defined in `conf/`

You can override the defaults by copying `settings.default.yaml` and/or `language.default.yaml` to `*.local.yaml` and adjusting the values.

**Note:** as there is no translation mechanism yet, the provided German language file `language-de.default.yaml` is just an example and needs to be copied manually to `language.local.yaml`, as described above.
